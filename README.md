# VRC-Error-Bot
 Provides simple responses to common VRChat development errors
 USAGE:
  - Download the release package
  - Extract the VRBot folder to your desired location, and double click setup.exe
  - Optionally create a shortcut for VRBot.application or setup.exe and drag to Desktop for quick access
  - Once open, type ? into the program for help
  - Use version check to check for updates
  - Currently the Stable and Experimental versions are both the same, however in the future the experimental will run on a newer, less tested database.
  - Type in any error code, error message, or any questions you have and the bot will tell you if it has found a response or not.
  - This is a very simple bot that runs of matching Regular Expressions, therefore it does not use any real form of AI, and therefore is not highly advanced
  - However with constant database updates, this bot can be a helpful tool to a VRChat developer
  - For any comments, questions, concerns, DM me on discord, P.Penguin#0420
